                Mashed potato or mashed potatoes, colloquially known as mash, is a dish made by mashing boiled or steamed potatoes, 
            usually with added milk, butter, salt and pepper. 
            It is generally served as a side dish to meat or vegetables. 
            Roughly mashed potatoes are sometimes called smashed potatoes.

                            Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. 
                            Add potatoes and garlic, lower heat to medium, 
                            and simmer until potatoes are tender, 15 to 20 minutes.

                        <li>
                            When the potatoes are almost finished, heat milk and butter in a small saucepan over low heat until butter is melted.

                            Drain potatoes and return to the pot. 
                            Slowly add warm milk mixture, blending it in with a potato masher or electric mixer until potatoes are smooth and creamy. 
                            Season with salt and pepper.
