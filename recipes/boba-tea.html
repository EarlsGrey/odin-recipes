                Bubble tea is a tea-based drink that originated in Taiwan in the early 1980s. 
                Taiwanese immigrants brought it to the United States in the 1990s, 
                initially in California through regions including Los Angeles County, 
                but the drink has also spread to other countries where there is a large East Asian diaspora population.
